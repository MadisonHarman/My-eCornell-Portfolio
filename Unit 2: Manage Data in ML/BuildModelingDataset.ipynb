So far we identified all columns in the dataset to serve as features, but not all features may be suitable for our machine learning problem. While feature engineering involves transforming your features into proper formats (e.g. transforming numerical data into binary values), it also includes selecting appropriate features for modeling. By exploring your data, you will identify trends, patterns, and interdependence among features and the label. This will enable you to choose the appropriate features to use for training your machine learning model."

It appears as though hours per week are stacked around the typical 40-hour value, and that this value of weekly hours dominates regardless of the level of education. However, it seems that it is somewhat less typical for people with lower levels of formal education to be working over 65 hours a week."

    "1. Based on what you have learned in this unit, try to interpret what you have discovered about the relationships between the features and the label in this exercise. Are the top two correlated features strongly or weakly correlated with the label? What about the remaining features? Are the two features strongly or weakly correlated with each other? Based on these answers, do these features seem appropriate to use for our machine learning problem? Are there other considerations that should be taken when selecting features for this problem (e.g. selecting different data, removing/adding features)?\n",

    "1. The top-two correlated features are weakly correlated with the label. However, when compared with the remaining features, they are still the most correlated with the label, even if it is a weak one. Furthermore, the two features are also weakly correlated with one another. Both of these notions are exemplified when observing the scatterplots. Thus, I believe that these features do not seem appropriate to use for our machine learning problem. When selecting the features for this problem, it is important to consider different pieces of data that may have a better correlation with the label, such as geographic location (urban vs. rural) or biological sex. Furthermore, deleting data that has negative correlation with the label can prevent redudancy.\n",
    "2. Other feature engineering techniques that should be used to make the data suitable for modeling (or obtaining a \"modeling dataset\")  are first sampling your data, transforming your data (through binary indicators, one-hot encoding, functional transformation, interaction terms, binning, scaling, etc.), cleaning your data, and finally analyzing your data. These are concepts that have been mentioned several times throughout this unit."
